# Basic Economic Concepts

## Scarcity

> In microeconomics, scarcity refers to the idea that **_resources are limited_**. It applies to **physical** resources like land, water, and oil, as well as intangible resources like time, skills, and attention. We have to make choices about how to allocate those resources.

## Four factors of productions:

imagine with a scenario : You are a owner of a farm

1. Land : you need a land to produce crops
2. Labor : Someone needs to work on your land in order to produce it
3. Capital : You need money and resources (electricity , motors etc) to perform the process. Financial assets that can be used in the future
4. Entrepreneurship/technology : Putting together all the other factors of ideas, so that you can produce goods
