# Specialization

- when an individual/company/country focuses on producing one thing or performing one part of a task

## Advantage

### Absolute Advantage :

> When a person or nation can produce **_more of something_** than another person or antion using the **_same amount of resources_**.

### Comparitive Advantage:

> When a person or nation can produce something **_most efficiently_** given all the products it **_could potentially produce_**

**So by calculating the _Opportunity Cost_ we can calculate whether someone or a country is in Absolute Advantage or Comparitive Advantage.**

## The law of Comparitive Advantage:

> each person shoudl _produce the good_ for which there is a _lower opportunity cost_ than other producers

# example:

| Farmers | apples | pears |
| :-----: | :----: | :---: |
|  Dave   |  100   |  50   |
|  Jill   |   75   |  25   |

- Dave is in the absolute advantage here in both cases because he can get 100 apples and 50 pears ready with in the same hour of time frame

- To get the comparive advantage let's figure out the opportunity cost:

  - oc for apple:

    | Farmers | OC of 1 apple |    pears     |
    | :-----: | :-----------: | :----------: |
    |  Dave   |  100/100 = 1  | 50/100 = 1/2 |
    |  Jill   |   75/75 = 1   | 25/75 = 1/3  |

  - oc for pears:

    | Farmers | OC of 1 pear |   apples   |
    | :-----: | :----------: | :--------: |
    |  Dave   |  50/50 = 1   | 100/50 = 2 |
    |  Jill   |  25/25 = 1   | 75/25 = 3  |

Result :

- The law of comparive advantage tells us that **lower the OC**,**higher the comparive advantage** and ppl should specialize in that particular field
- For apples Jill has the comparive advantage. For pears Dave has the comparive advantage. So Jill should specialize in apples and Dave should specialize in pears.
- Dave can trade 1/2 an apple for 1 pears
- Jill can trade 2 pears for 1 apple
